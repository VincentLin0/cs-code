# This is a pattern similar to pokemon character adventure game, with a game engine server that communicates with one or more game clients.
# Each player can trigger different actions in different scenarios, such as getting wood in storeroom or picking up keys in forest. What is more, Keys can be used to open doors in cabins and wood can be made into axes. When new entities are created, the old ones will be deleted.
# The game has a "health level" feature. Each player start with a health level of 3. Interaction with beneficial or dangerous characters will increase or decrease a player's health by one point. For example, players might be attacked by wild wolves in the woods. 
# When a player's health runs out (i.e. when it becomes zero) they will lose all of the items in their inventory (which are dropped in the location where they ran out of health) They will then be transported to the start location of the game and their health level restored to the full level (i.e. 3).
